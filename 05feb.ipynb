        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: It is the mechanism of wrapping the data (attributes) and code (methods) that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. It provides a level of abstraction, which makes the code more maintainable and secure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: It is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. It enables the creation of new classes from existing classes. This helps in reducing code duplication, increasing code reuse and promoting code readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, method overriding and operator overloading. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: It is the technique of exposing only the necessary information to the user and hiding the implementation details. Abstraction enables the implementation of objects in a more modular way, making the code more maintainable and scalable."

When a method is called on an instance, the instance is automatically passed to the method as the first argument, which can be accessed using self. This allows the method to access and modify the attributes of the instance."

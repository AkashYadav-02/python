        "'w' (Write Only) : This mode is used to open a file for writing only. If the file exists, its content is truncated, otherwise, a new file is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "'a' (Append Only) : This mode is used to open a file for writing only. If the file exists, the pointer is placed at the end of the file, and data is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans.The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened in Python. Closing a file is important for a number of reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Releases resources: When a file is opened, system resources are reserved for it, such as memory and file handles. When the file is no longer needed, it's important to release these resources by closing the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevents data corruption: When a file is left open, it can be vulnerable to data corruption, such as when the program that opened the file crashes or is terminated. Closing the file ensures that any data that was written to it is saved and the file is in a consistent state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Allows other programs to access the file: When a file is left open, other programs may not be able to access it because the operating system locks it. Closing the file releases the lock and allows other programs to access the file if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improves performance: If a large number of files are left open, it can slow down the performance of the system. Closing files that are no longer needed helps to improve the overall performance of the system."

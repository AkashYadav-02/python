        "\n",
        "Ans:The Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance are two commonly used distance metrics in KNN. The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space and is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. It takes into account both horizontal and vertical changes in coordinates. On the other hand, Manhattan distance measures the total absolute differences between coordinates, summing up the horizontal and vertical distances separately, resembling the travel distance along a grid of streets (like the layout of Manhattan, hence the name).\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of distance metric can affect KNN's performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Euclidean distance is sensitive to the scale of the features and is more appropriate when the data is continuous and the relationship between features is linear.\n",
        "Manhattan distance is more robust to noise and outliers since it does not rely on large squared differences. It is useful when the data has categorical or discrete features.\n",
        "In terms of performance, Euclidean distance tends to perform better when the features are correlated or when data points lie closer to each other in a straight line. Manhattan distance, however, may perform better in high-dimensional spaces or with sparse data since it does not \"stretch\" the distance calculation as much as Euclidean distance."

        "\n",
        "Ans:Choosing the optimal value of k is a critical aspect of KNN model performance. A small value of k (e.g., k=1) can lead to high variance and overfitting, where the model is too sensitive to noise. A larger value of k can result in high bias and underfitting, as the model may overlook important patterns in the data.\n",

        "To determine the optimal value of k, several techniques can be used:\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets. The model is trained on k-1 subsets and tested on the remaining one, rotating through all subsets to evaluate performance. This helps identify the k value that minimizes cross-validation error.\n",
        "Grid search: This method involves testing a range of k values and evaluating model performance for each. The k that produces the best performance metric (e.g., accuracy, RMSE) is selected.\n",
        "Elbow method: Plot the error (such as classification error or MSE) against different values of k. The optimal value of k is typically at the \"elbow\" of the curve, where the error starts to level off."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The choice of distance metric can have a significant impact on the performance of a KNN model. Euclidean distance is appropriate when the data is continuous and the relationship between features is linear. It tends to work well when the scale of the data is similar across features and the data does not have many outliers.\n",

        "On the other hand, Manhattan distance is better when the data has a high-dimensional space, is sparse, or includes discrete/categorical features. Manhattan distance may perform better in settings where data points are spread out across grid-like structures and when the relationship between features is not strictly linear.\n",

        "Feature types: If your data includes categorical variables, Manhattan distance might be more effective.\n",
